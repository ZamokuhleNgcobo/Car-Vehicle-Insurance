Insurance policies involve companies providing compensation for specific losses or damages in exchange for regular premium payments. This applies to vehicle insurance, where customers pay an annual premium to an insurance provider. In the event of an unfortunate accident involving the vehicle, the insurance company will provide compensation, known as the ‘sum assured’, to the customer. This arrangement ensures coverage and protection for the customer in case of accidents or damages to their vehicle.

This project focuses on conducting a probability analysis using a dataset of vehicle insurance. The dataset includes valuable information on demographics, vehicles, and insurance policies. Demographic factors such as gender, age, and region code type, along with vehicle-related data like vehicle age and damage, are analyzed. The insurance policy details, including premium and sourcing channel, are also considered. The objective of this analysis is to examine the probabilistic relationships between these variables and gain insights into the factors that affect vehicle insurance.
